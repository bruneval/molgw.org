# Running series of calculations with python

It is possible to automate **MOLGW** with a python module named `molgw.py`.

First make sure that the module is in the `PYTHONPATH`:
```sh
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/molgw/utils
```

Then checkout the two jupyter notebooks:

```sh
jupyter notebook /path/to/molgw/docs/running_molgw_with_jupyter.ipynb
```

and

```sh
jupyter notebook /path/to/molgw/docs/gw100_benchmark.ipynb
```
